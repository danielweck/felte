# Contributing to Felte

Thank you so much for even considering contributing to this project! If you wish to help out with Felte I hope the following information will make it as easy as possible for you.

## About the project

This project is a monorepo containing all the packages related to Felte, as well as its documentation site. These are all contained within the `packages/` directory. We are currently using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to manage this repo's dependencies and [Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to maintain versioning and changelogs.

Most of the packages use TypeScript for type safety, and all of them use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) for bundling.

## Local package development

In order to run this locally, fork this repo and clone it to your machine. You then will install dependencies using `pnpm`. This an all other commands we show in this guide will be run in the root folder of the monorepo.

```sh
pnpm i
```

### All packages

In order build all packages you can also use `pnpm`.

```sh
pnpm build
```

This will build all packages except for the docs site.

If you want to watch your changes so Rollup makes a new build everytime you change a file, use:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will watch ALL packages.

> Note that if you change any TypeScript types you will need to run `pnpm build` for them to be re-bundled. For now, dev mode does not generate new types. This should only be a issue if you're modyfing `@felte/common`, though.

### Per package

If you want to scope your commands to a single package you can filter per-package with `pnpm`. The following would build only the `@felte/common` package. The `--filter` option allows you to only run the command on specific packages. The name within `--filter` is the name inside each of the packages' `package.json` (a.k.a. the name they're published as).

```sh
pnpm -r --filter='@felte/common' build
```

Something similar would be done if you want to watch your changes:

> NOTE: Running more than one package will require using `--parallel`.

```sh
pnpm -r --filter='@felte/common' dev
```

### Testing

We care about test coverage and test quality, if you add new code/new features, it would be really nice if you add tests to it. All packages except for Felte's documentation site have tests that aim to >90% code coverage. You can run tests for all packages using:

```sh
# runs all tests
pnpm test

# runs all tests with coverage
pnpm test:ci
```

If you want to run tests for a single package, we can use `pnpm` again to scope the command:

```sh
# runs tests
pnpm -r --filter='@felte/common' test

# runs tests with coverage
pnpm -r --filter='@felte/common' test:ci
```

Felte uses [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu) as a test runner, which provides a really fast execution of tests. Since uvu itself is only a test runner, we use [sinonjs](https://sinonjs.org) to handle mocking of functions, and [uvu-exect](https://github.com/pablo-abc/uvu-expect) with [uvu-expect-dom](https://github.com/pablo-abc/uvu-expect-dom) to handle assertions.

## Local documentation site development

We are using [Astro](https://astro.build) for the documentation site. You can run a development build of it with:

```sh
pnpm site:dev
```

Or you can run a production build using:

```sh
pnpm site:build # makes a production build

pnpm site:preview # runs the production build
```

All documentation files for the site are made using Markdown, and they're contained in the `packages/site/markdown/docs/` directory. Its structure right now was made for future i18n and multiple versioning, but right now there's only documentation in the `packages/site/markdown/docs/en/latest` directory.

If you're making changes to any package that require documentation, it would be nice if you could update this as well.

Adding a new section to the docs page would require adding a new markdown file next to the other docs files with the same format as the rest. Then adding the file name (without the extension) to the `sections` object `packages/site/src/other/sections.json`. Add the file name where you want the section to be related to the others.

## Commit messages

We are using [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to make sure our commits adhere to a standard. We are following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards. If your commit does not follow this standard it will fail. When making a pull request, also make sure to make your PR title follow this standard.

When commiting or making a PR for a specific package, please scope your commit/PR title. The scopes we use right now are the same as the directory names inside of the `packages/` directory. An example would be:

```
feat(validator-yup): some change description
```

If your changes touch multiple packages, it's ok to not scope it.

## "I'm not quite sure how to document/test my changes"

That's OK! Any help is better than no help, if you're not sure what the best approach would be to add tests/documentation to your changes, I can get around to it. Adding these would just help me a lot with the work.

The only documentation requirement I really ask for is to add the `changeset` as described in the next section.

## Making a pull request

When making a pull request, we want any changes you make to be documented. This is where `Changesets` comes in. `Changesets` will help you document which changes you're making. For this you can run:

```sh
pnpx changeset
```

And go to the prompts it'll give you.

- First it will ask you to select which packages are the ones changing
- Then it will ask you to select which packages require major/minor/patch bumps.
- Finally it will ask you to provide a summary of your changes. This will be added to the CHANGELOG.md of the package you're modifying so make sure it's clear and understandable.

For now, since we are pre 1.0.0, breaking changes may be included in minor versions. Just make sure to add `BREAKING:` to the summary so it is documented.

Running this command will generate a markdown file in the `.changeset/` directory. Commit this file alongside your changes!

> Whatever your PR is about, either an enhancement or a bug fix, it would be nice if you could open an Issue alongside it for good tracking.

## Issues you can help with

There are a few minor things I haven't gotten around to solve yet. If you have an idea on how to solve them, you may give it a try:

- A way to offer input masking would be nice to have. Integration with `imask` probably would be the way to go, since `svelte-imask` does not play well with Felte.
- A better alternative to the `multi-step` package is needed. Preferably something that does not depend on any specific framework. Currently we are recommending handling this manually.
- Some help from someone more experienced with TypeScript could help improve how we internally handle types.
